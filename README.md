## Design Philosophy

### Visual Design

- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: White (#FFFFFF)
  - Accent: Soft blue/gray (#E0E5F0)
  - Text: Dark gray (#333333)
  - Subtle grays for separation and emphasis

- **Typography**:
  - Body Text: Inter (sans-serif)
  - Headings: Space Grotesk (sans-serif)
  - Font sizes scale proportionally across devices

- **Visual Elements**:
  - Rounded corners (border-radius) for cards and buttons
  - Soft drop shadows for depth and hierarchy
  - Subtle section separators
  - Consistent spacing and alignment

### User Interface Principles

- **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and content organization
- **Consistency**: Uniform design patterns across all pages
- **Feedback**: Visual responses to user interactions
- **Efficiency**: Minimal clicks to access information
- **Accessibility**: Readable text, sufficient contrast, semantic markup

## Technical Implementation

### HTML

- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- Proper heading hierarchy for document outline
- Descriptive alt text for images (placeholders currently)
- Logical tab order for keyboard navigation

### CSS

- Custom properties (CSS variables) for consistent styling
- Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsive layouts
- Media queries for responsive design breakpoints
- CSS animations and transitions for interactive elements
- BEM-inspired naming convention for maintainable CSS

### JavaScript

- Event listeners for interactive elements
- Mobile menu toggle functionality
- Project filtering system using data attributes
- Intersection Observer API for scroll animations
- Expandable project details with toggle functionality

## Performance Optimizations

- Minimal external resources (only Google Fonts)
- CSS animations instead of JavaScript where possible
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- No unnecessary libraries or frameworks
- Lazy-loading of off-screen content

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
